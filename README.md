House_Price_Predictor:

Files Includes With This Project: 
  main.cpp
  Predictor.h
  Predictor.cpp
  Plotter.py
  data_file.txt

Design Decisions & Project Issues: 
  This program predicts the prices of houses using the Cost Function and the Gradient Descent Algorithm. The user can enter data into the program, if the user can read data from
  an existing file. Once the data is read in, the Python script (Plotter.py) can be run to graph the data using the Matplotlib package. The main function in Cpp will then 
  use the data to calculate and graph the cost function. Then the gradient descent algorithm will be used to predict the price of the house based on the square footage entered.

File Sizes:

total - //Will be updated upon completion

Running Constraints: 
  main.cpp must be run first, and there must be either valid data in the data file, OR entered into the program. 
  Then the Python scripts must be run seperately to visualize the data.
